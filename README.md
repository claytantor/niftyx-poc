A proof of concept for a xumm app demonstrating the concept of "Hybrid xApps" which are xApps that have three authentication modes:

* xApp - xumm apps are authenticated by the using the application inside the xumm mobile app and the xumm API via the xAuthToken generated by the xumm app.
* Browser OAuth2 - xApps can also be authenticated by the user via a browser based OAuth2 flow. This is the most common way to authenticate a web app.
* Server Side JWT Backend - Both modes produce a JWT, this JWT can be used to protect backend calls.

## Architecture

The project includes all implementations required to run a xumm app, a browser based OAuth2 flow and a server side JWT backend. The project is a simple FastAPI app that can be run locally or deployed to a server. The app is a simple stub that can be used to build any new xapp, as a ReactJS app that can be built and deployed to a server or as a static site.
