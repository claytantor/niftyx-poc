A proof of concept for a xumm app demonstrating the concept of "Hybrid xApps" which are xApps that have three authentication modes:

* xApp - xumm apps are authenticated by the using the application inside the xumm mobile app and the xumm API via the xAuthToken generated by the xumm app.
* Browser OAuth2 - xApps can also be authenticated by the user via a browser based OAuth2 flow. This is the most common way to authenticate a web app.
* Server Side JWT Backend - Both modes produce a JWT, this JWT can be used to protect backend calls.


## Setup

## simple app stub for a new app

* uvicorn app.main:app --reload foo
* webapp: http://localhost:1234
